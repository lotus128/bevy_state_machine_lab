DESIGN I need to think if I want all state machine to be a "type" of state machine, or for each entity to be its own state machine.
In such case, the state machine would need to track its own transitions etc.

STORY I need "enter conditions" and "exit conditions" per state/ state group.
STORY I want a builder with commands so that I can create the resources I need.
